            Hello, I’m Anjana, a team mentor with extensive experience in digital marketing and analytics. I worked as an implementation specialist for Google Ads Conversion, Google Analytics, and Google Tag Manager. My expertise lies in setting up and optimizing tracking solutions that drive data-informed decision-making, ensuring businesses gain deeper insights into their online performance.
<br><br>

           In my role as an implementation specialist, I was responsible for configuring conversion tracking for Google Ads, enabling businesses to measure and optimize their campaign success. With Google Analytics, I helped set up comprehensive tracking and reporting, empowering teams to better understand user behavior and website performance. My experience with Google Tag Manager further enhanced my ability to streamline tag management processes, reducing the need for ongoing developer involvement and ensuring a more agile marketing approach.<br><br>

            As a team mentor, I now focus on guiding teams through the complexities of tracking, optimization, ensuring that they can effectively leverage Google’s tools to meet their goals. I am passionate about creating a collaborative environment where my team members can thrive, continually improve, and contribute meaningfully to project success.
<br><br>

            My combined background in both technical implementation and team leadership allows me to bring a unique perspective to my current role, where I aim to empower others through knowledge sharing, mentorship, and a focus on continuous growth and learning.<br><br>
